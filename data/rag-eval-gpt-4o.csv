"Certainly! Let's examine the chord progression for Nirvana's song ""Come As You Are.""

### Chord Progression:
- **Em – D – Em – D – Em – C – B7 – Em**

### Explanation:
- **Key**: The song is in the key of E minor.
- **Roman Numerals**: 
  - i (Em) – VII (D) – i (Em) – VII (D) – i (Em) – VI (C) – V7 (B7) – i (Em)
  
### Theoretical Analysis:
- The progression begins and ends with the tonic minor chord (Em), which helps establish the key.
- The D major chord functions as a VII chord, providing a distinctive change from the minor tonic and adding tension that resolves back to Em.
- The C major chord serves as a VI chord, giving a lift before descending to the B7 chord.
- The B7 chord is a dominant 7th (V7), and it provides a strong pull back to the tonic minor chord, creating an authentic cadence (V7–i).

### Additional Notes:
- **Grunge Harmony**: The use of chords like the power chords here is typical in grunge music, offering a simple yet effective harmonic structure.
- **Tension and Resolution**: The VII and V7 chords introduce tension that resolves satisfyingly to the tonic minor chord (Em).
